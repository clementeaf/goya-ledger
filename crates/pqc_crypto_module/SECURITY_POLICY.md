# Security Policy — pqc_crypto_module v0.1.0

> **Disclaimer**: This module is prepared for FIPS 140-3 evaluation and is not currently validated. This document is structured to align with FIPS 140-3 Security Policy requirements (NIST IG 7.1) but has not been reviewed by a CMVP-accredited laboratory.

---

## 1. Module Name and Identification

- **Module name**: `pqc_crypto_module`
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Type**: Software cryptographic module
- **Security level target**: FIPS 140-3 Level 1 (software only)
- **Description**: A Rust-based post-quantum cryptographic module providing digital signature, key encapsulation, and hashing services for the Cerulean Ledger distributed ledger platform.

## 2. Cryptographic Boundary

The cryptographic boundary encompasses all source files within `crates/pqc_crypto_module/src/`:

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `api.rs` | Single public entry point for all approved operations |
| `mldsa.rs` | ML-DSA-65 key generation, signing, verification |
| `mlkem.rs` | ML-KEM-768 key encapsulation (FIPS 203) |
| `hashing.rs` | SHA3-256 hashing |
| `rng.rs` | CSPRNG wrapper with continuous test |
| `self_tests.rs` | Known Answer Tests (KATs) |
| `approved_mode.rs` | State machine and approved-mode enforcement |
| `types.rs` | Cryptographic types with zeroization |
| `errors.rs` | Error types |
| `legacy.rs` | Non-approved algorithms (outside approved boundary) |
| `lib.rs` | Module re-exports |

The boundary is enforced by the Rust crate system. External code accesses approved cryptographic operations through `pqc_crypto_module::api` (state-guarded) or `pqc_crypto_module::mldsa`/`mlkem`/`slhdsa` (internal modules with `require_approved()` guards). Non-approved legacy algorithms (Ed25519, SHA-256) are accessed through `pqc_crypto_module::legacy`, which is blocked in `Approved` state and excluded entirely under `--features approved-only`. Boundary integrity is verified by `tests/api_boundary.rs` and `tests/crypto_boundary`.

Files outside `src/` (tests, Cargo.toml, documentation) are outside the cryptographic boundary.

## 3. Approved Algorithms

| Algorithm | Standard | Purpose | Key Sizes | Output Sizes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ML-DSA-65 | FIPS 204 | Digital signatures | PK: 1952 B, SK: 4032 B | Sig: 3309 B |
| ML-KEM-768 | FIPS 203 | Key encapsulation | PK: 1184 B, SK: 2400 B, CT: 1088 B | SS: 32 B |
| SHA3-256 | FIPS 202 | Hashing | N/A | 32 B |

**Implementation note**: ML-KEM-768 is implemented via the `pqcrypto-mlkem` crate (v0.1.1), which wraps the reference C implementation of FIPS 203. Encapsulation produces a ciphertext and shared secret; decapsulation deterministically recovers the same shared secret. Invalid ciphertexts are handled via implicit rejection (different shared secret) or error return.

## 4. Non-Approved Algorithms

The following algorithms are present for backward compatibility with pre-PQC ledger data. They are **not part of the approved cryptographic boundary**.

| Algorithm | Purpose | Gating Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Ed25519 | Legacy signature verification | `ensure_not_approved()` runtime guard |
| SHA-256 | Legacy block hashing | `ensure_not_approved()` runtime guard |
| HMAC-SHA256 | Legacy MAC operations | `ensure_not_approved()` runtime guard |

When the module is in `Approved` state, all non-approved algorithm calls return `CryptoError::NonApprovedAlgorithm`. The `approved-only` Cargo feature excludes the `legacy` module entirely at compile time via `compile_error!`.

See [NON_APPROVED_USAGE.md](NON_APPROVED_USAGE.md) for details.

## 5. Roles and Authentication

| Role | Description | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| Crypto Officer (CO) | Initializes the module by calling `initialize_approved_mode()` | Implicit: first caller at process startup |
| User | Calls approved cryptographic services (sign, verify, hash, encapsulate, decapsulate) | Module state check: `require_approved()` guard |

Both roles require the module to be in `Approved` state before any cryptographic service is available. There is no password-based or identity-based authentication at the module level; authentication is delegated to the DLT application layer (mTLS + ACL).

## 6. Services

### Approved-mode services (available only in `Approved` state)

| Service | API Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Module initialization | `initialize_approved_mode()` | Run self-tests, transition to Approved |
| ML-DSA key generation | `generate_mldsa_keypair()` | Generate ML-DSA-65 keypair |
| ML-DSA signing | `sign_message(sk, msg)` | Sign a message |
| ML-DSA verification | `verify_signature(pk, msg, sig)` | Verify a signature |
| SHA3-256 hashing | `sha3_256(data)` | Compute SHA3-256 digest |
| ML-KEM key generation | `generate_mlkem_keypair()` | Generate ML-KEM-768 keypair |
| ML-KEM encapsulation | `mlkem_encapsulate(pk)` | Encapsulate shared secret |
| ML-KEM decapsulation | `mlkem_decapsulate(sk, ct)` | Decapsulate shared secret |
| Random byte generation | `random_bytes(n)` | Generate n cryptographically secure random bytes |

### Non-approved services (blocked in `Approved` state)

| Service | API Function |
|---|---|
| Legacy Ed25519 sign | `legacy_ed25519_sign(sk, msg)` |
| Legacy Ed25519 verify | `legacy_ed25519_verify(pk, msg, sig)` |
| Legacy SHA-256 | `legacy_sha256(data)` |
| Legacy HMAC-SHA256 | `legacy_hmac_sha256(key, data)` |

## 7. Finite State Model

The module operates as a four-state machine managed by an `AtomicU8` with `SeqCst` ordering:

```
Uninitialized ──[initialize_approved_mode()]──> SelfTesting
SelfTesting   ──[all KATs pass]──────────────> Approved
SelfTesting   ──[any KAT fails]─────────────> Error
```

- **Uninitialized (0)**: Initial state. All approved operations return `ModuleNotInitialized`.
- **SelfTesting (1)**: Transient state during KAT execution.
- **Approved (2)**: Operational state. All approved services are available.
- **Error (3)**: Terminal state. All operations return `ModuleInErrorState`. Recovery requires process restart.

Forbidden transitions: `Error` to any other state; `Approved` to `Uninitialized`; `Uninitialized` directly to `Approved`.

See [FINITE_STATE_MODEL.md](FINITE_STATE_MODEL.md) for the complete model.

## 8. Physical Security

This is a software-only module. No physical security mechanisms are claimed. The module operates within the physical security perimeter of the host operating system and hardware.

## 9. Operational Environment

- **Operating system**: Linux (x86_64, aarch64) or macOS (aarch64)
- **Runtime**: Single-process, multi-threaded Rust application
- **Randomness source**: OS-backed CSPRNG via `OsRng` (backed by `getrandom` syscall)
- **Compiler**: Rust nightly toolchain (required for `#![feature(unsigned_is_multiple_of)]` in the parent workspace; the module itself uses stable Rust features)

The module assumes a single-operator environment where the operating system provides process isolation and memory protection.

## 10. Key Management

### Key types

| Type | Size | Zeroization | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MldsaPrivateKey` | 4032 B | `ZeroizeOnDrop` | ML-DSA-65 signing |
| `MldsaPublicKey` | 1952 B | N/A (public) | ML-DSA-65 verification |
| `MlKemPrivateKey` | 2400 B | `ZeroizeOnDrop` | ML-KEM-768 decapsulation |
| `MlKemPublicKey` | 1184 B | N/A (public) | ML-KEM-768 encapsulation |
| `MlKemSharedSecret` | 32 B | `ZeroizeOnDrop` | Shared secret material |

### Key lifecycle

- **Generation**: Keys are generated inside the module using approved algorithms and OS-backed CSPRNG.
- **Storage**: Keys exist only in process memory. The module does not persist keys to disk.
- **Usage**: Keys are used exclusively through the approved API functions.
- **Destruction**: Private keys and shared secrets implement `ZeroizeOnDrop`. Memory is overwritten with zeros when the containing variable is dropped.

See [KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](KEY_MANAGEMENT.md) for the complete key management policy.

## 11. Self-Tests

Self-tests run during `initialize_approved_mode()` before any cryptographic service becomes available.

| Test | Algorithm | Method |
|---|---|---|
| KAT SHA3-256 | SHA3-256 | Hash empty string, compare to known digest |
| KAT ML-DSA-65 | ML-DSA-65 | Generate keypair, sign, verify, corrupt signature, verify rejection |
| KAT ML-KEM | ML-KEM-768 | Generate keypair, encapsulate, decapsulate |
| Continuous RNG test | OsRng | Generate two 32-byte outputs, verify they differ |

If any test fails, the module transitions to `Error` state. All subsequent operations are rejected. The module cannot be re-initialized; the process must be restarted.

See [SELF_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md](SELF_TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md) for the complete self-test specification.

## 12. Mitigation of Other Attacks

| Attack vector | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Side-channel timing | ML-DSA and ML-KEM implementations from `pqcrypto` use constant-time reference code |
| Memory disclosure | Private keys and shared secrets implement `ZeroizeOnDrop` |
| Algorithm downgrade | Runtime guard (`ensure_not_approved()`) + compile-time exclusion (`approved-only` feature) |
| State manipulation | `AtomicU8` with `SeqCst` ordering; `Error` state is terminal |
| RNG failure | Continuous RNG test at startup; explicit error propagation on `OsRng` failure |

## 13. Error State and Recovery

The `Error` state is **terminal**. Once entered, no cryptographic operations can be performed and no transition to any other state is possible.

**Recovery procedure:**
1. The Crypto Officer observes that all API calls return `CryptoError::ModuleInErrorState`.
2. The Crypto Officer must terminate the host process.
3. The Crypto Officer restarts the process. The module re-enters `Uninitialized` state.
4. `initialize_approved_mode()` is called again. If self-tests pass, the module transitions to `Approved`.
5. If self-tests fail again, the Crypto Officer must investigate the root cause (corrupted binary, hardware fault, or dependency issue) before retrying.

**Operator indicators:**
- `CryptoError::ModuleInErrorState` on any API call → module is in Error state.
- `CryptoError::ModuleNotInitialized` → module has not been initialized (call `initialize_approved_mode()`).
- `CryptoError::SelfTestFailed(msg)` → initialization failed; module transitioned to Error.

There is no in-process re-initialization path. This is by design: a self-test failure may indicate a compromised binary or hardware fault, and continuing operation would violate fail-closed semantics.

## 14. Crypto Officer Procedures

### Module initialization
1. At process startup, call `pqc_crypto_module::api::initialize_approved_mode()`.
2. If the call returns `Ok(())`, the module is in `Approved` state and all services are available.
3. If the call returns `Err(SelfTestFailed(_))`, the module is in `Error` state. Terminate the process, investigate, and restart.
4. Do not attempt to call `initialize_approved_mode()` more than once per process lifetime.

### Monitoring
- All API functions return `Result<T, CryptoError>`. The Crypto Officer should log and alert on any `Err` variant.
- Periodic health checks: call `sha3_256(b"healthcheck")` and verify a successful result.

### Incident response
- If any operation returns `ModuleInErrorState`, treat the process as compromised and restart immediately.
- If signature verification fails unexpectedly, investigate key compromise before retrying.

## 15. User Guide

### For DLT application developers
- Import only `pqc_crypto_module::api`. Do not import internal modules.
- Call `initialize_approved_mode()` exactly once at process startup before any crypto operation.
- Handle all `Result` errors explicitly. Do not `unwrap()` in production.
- Private keys (`MldsaPrivateKey`, `MlKemPrivateKey`) are `ZeroizeOnDrop`. Let them drop naturally or call `drop()` explicitly when done.
- Shared secrets (`MlKemSharedSecret`) are also `ZeroizeOnDrop`. Derive session keys or MACs promptly, then drop.

### For legacy compatibility
- Use `pqc_crypto_module::legacy::*` only for verifying pre-PQC data.
- Legacy functions are blocked when the module is in `Approved` state.
- Plan migration to ML-DSA-65 and ML-KEM-768 for all new operations.

## 16. ACVP / CAVP Test Vector Coverage

### C2SP Wycheproof (Community — widely used by crypto libraries)

| Algorithm | Test Type | Vectors | Categories |
|---|---|---|---|
| ML-DSA-65 | Signature verification | 10 | Valid baseline, ModifiedSignature, InvalidContext, InvalidHintsEncoding, IncorrectSignatureLength, wrong pk size |

### Internal Gauntlet (beyond any blockchain DLT)

| Category | Tests | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| FIPS 204/203 parameter conformance | 6 | pk/sk/sig/ct/ss sizes match spec tables |
| Randomized signing proof | 1 | ML-DSA non-deterministic per §5.2 |
| Bit-level corruption sweep | 2 | 100+ byte positions, 9 boundary×flip combos |

**Total: 133 tests across 12 suites in `pqc_crypto_module`.**

### Deterministic Keygen Infrastructure

The module includes a C FFI binding (`csrc/keypair_from_seed.c`) that implements FIPS 204 §5.1 `ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal(ξ)` — identical to PQClean's `crypto_sign_keypair()` but with the seed passed as a parameter instead of generated internally. This enables NIST ACVP Known Answer Testing and produces byte-exact output matching the NIST ACVP-Server published expected results.

## 17. Future Validation Notes

The following items are identified for resolution before formal CMVP submission:

1. ~~**ML-KEM-768**~~: RESOLVED — implemented via `pqcrypto-mlkem` v0.1.1 with roundtrip verification.
2. ~~**ACVP keygen vectors**~~: RESOLVED — 3 official NIST vectors, byte-exact match via `keypair_from_seed` FFI.
3. **DRBG**: The module delegates randomness to the OS CSPRNG via `getrandom` (Linux: CRNG backed by ChaCha20 since 4.8, CTR_DRBG in FIPS mode; macOS: `SecRandomCopyBytes` backed by Fortuna/CTR_DRBG). For FIPS 140-3 Level 1, this is acceptable when the operational environment runs on a FIPS-validated OS kernel (e.g., RHEL 9 with `fips=1`). A standalone SP 800-90A DRBG wrapper is not required at Level 1 for software-only modules but may be required at Level 2+. Decision: **defer standalone DRBG** until lab feedback; document OS entropy delegation.
4. **Entropy source**: Randomness is sourced from `getrandom(2)` (Linux) or `SecRandomCopyBytes` (macOS). SP 800-90B compliance is inherited from the OS kernel's entropy subsystem. The module performs a continuous RNG test (SP 800-90B §4.3) at startup and rejects identical consecutive outputs. Documented in `rng.rs`.
5. **Physical boundary**: Not applicable (software module), but the operational environment documentation may need expansion for the lab.
6. **Algorithm certificates**: Obtain CAVP algorithm certificates for ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-768, and SHA3-256 once implementations are validated.
7. **Conditional self-tests**: Add pair-wise consistency tests for key generation if required by the lab.
8. ~~**ML-KEM shared secret verification**~~: RESOLVED — KAT self-test now verifies shared secret equality between encapsulate and decapsulate.
9. ~~**ACVP sigGen**~~: RESOLVED — `sign_internal_derand` FFI, 3 vectors byte-exact match.
10. ~~**ACVP ML-KEM**~~: RESOLVED — `keypair_derand` + `enc_derand` FFI, 6 vectors byte-exact match.
